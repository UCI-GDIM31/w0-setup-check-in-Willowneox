# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [**] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class? A: I hope to learn the basic programming concepts needed in game design from this class, and I also want to use this knowledge to understand which is more suited for me: design or programming. Additionally, I hope this class will help me feel less confused about the programming parts in the group activities of my following game design courses.
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
   A basic level of python

3. Game development (any engine)
   N/A

5. Unity
   N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
   It's a document that include the game theme, setting, background, genre, plot, target markets and platforms, play mechanics and also have to clear and definite the style of visual design. Besides these, the production plan, development process and tiemline need to be included in the document. Technical requirements and hardware also should be mentioned in the document.

3. Scope management
   Scope management is mainly used to control the out-of-scope output that may occur during the game production process, which may eventually lead to delayed release or development failure. It mainly clarifies the content, plot, and gameplay required in the game.

5. Iteration
   Iteration is a process of revising the game constanly. Producer need to have the prototype for the game first, and give the prototype to some players for testing. During the testing, get the problems and player feedback from the game, then modify or improve the game base on these. Repeat this process until the game is officially released.
7. Object-Oriented programming
   N/A
   

9. Model-View-Controller architecture
   Model is made by data. That create the basic logic of game. View is the visualization of the model, help player to understand the game. Controller is responsible for input and output. The operations from player will be inputted to the controller as the data change and then controller will output as view change to the player.
